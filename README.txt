This is a computer implementation of the game Tic-Tac-Toe. 

Currently, to play the game you must interact with it through the command line. In a future release you'll be able to play the game through a web interface.

First, change into the game/src directory and run the following command (assuming you have python installed):

python play_game.py

The game will then start. You'll be prompted to choose your piece. Once you have your piece you can begin playing the game.

You can make a move by entering a number between 1 to 9, where the numbers correspond to the following positions on the game-board:
 _ _ _
|1|2|3|
|_|_|_|
|4|5|6|
|_|_|_|
|7|8|9|
|_|_|_|

You will then see your piece get placed in the corresponding position. The computer will then make its move and the gameplay will go back and forth between you and the computer until either someone wins or the game ends in a draw.
